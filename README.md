To start the server type flask run in the terminal, or python3 app.py
or just start the app.py in your compiler


If you run the bot.py program, you have to choose a name for your bot:
yoy just type the name you want after bot.py e.g bot.py Fredrik
then Fredrik starts
from this list: Fredrik, Joakim ....

The bot will enter a room if available or make a new one if there isnt any rooms.

then send a message to the server in that room / still trying to make this work



If you run the client program:
Start by running python3 client.py in your terminal
You choose this by input from user(You)
The choices you have are:

adduser: for adding a new user
getusers: to get current users
addchatroom: to add a new chatroom
getchatrooms: to get current chatrooms

We have tried to add all the operations and restrictions that the task asked for but have struggled
to add some functions and the global restrictions. what we have managed to create is a server where 
we can add chatrooms and users, we also have bots that can be added to the rooms.
